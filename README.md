# Array Practice

## Overview

This project was created to **practice manipulating arrays** in JavaScript. It contains various challenges that explore core array methods such as `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `reduce()`. By working through these exercises, I aimed to strengthen my understanding of how arrays can be manipulated and processed.

## Challenges & Features

### 1. Filter Inventors Born in the 1500s

Using the `filter()` method, I extracted a list of inventors born between 1500 and 1599. The results are logged in the console with their birth years.

### 2. Create an Array of Inventors' Full Names

I used the `map()` method to create an array of strings combining the inventors' first and last names. This challenge helped me understand how `map()` can transform array data.

### 3. Sort Inventors by Birthdate (Oldest to Youngest)

The `sort()` method is applied to arrange the inventors by their birth year, from oldest to youngest, and the results are displayed in a table format using `console.table()`.

### 4. Calculate Total Years Lived by All Inventors

By using the `reduce()` method, I calculated the total number of years all inventors lived. This challenge helped me learn how to accumulate values from an array.

### 5. Sort Inventors by Years Lived

The inventors were sorted by the number of years they lived using the `sort()` method, from those who lived the longest to the shortest.

### 6. Create a List of Boulevards in Paris Containing "de"

I used the `map()` and `filter()` methods to extract all boulevards in Paris that contain "de" in their names from the Wikipedia page.

### 7. Sort People Alphabetically by Last Name

This challenge required sorting an array of people alphabetically by last name. I used the `split()` method to break each name into first and last names and then applied `sort()`.

### 8. Sum Up Instances of Each Item in an Array

A list of transportation methods was provided, and I used the `reduce()` method to count the occurrences of each item in the array (e.g., how many times "car" appears).

## How It Works

- **JavaScript Console**: All challenges log their output directly to the JavaScript console. To see the results, open the browser's developer tools and look at the console.
- **Array Methods**: The project showcases how to manipulate arrays using different JavaScript methods:
  - `filter()`: To extract items based on specific conditions.
  - `map()`: To transform elements of an array.
  - `sort()`: To reorder array elements based on custom logic.
  - `reduce()`: To aggregate data from an array into a single value or object.

## Lessons Learned

- Improved my understanding of array manipulation through `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `reduce()`.
- Practiced writing concise yet functional code to process arrays.
- Reinforced my knowledge of JavaScript's console methods for debugging and testing array operations.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Open the **JavaScript Console** by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac).
3. Watch the console as it logs results for each of the array manipulation challenges.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides a simple structure for the page.
- **JavaScript**: Focuses on array manipulation using various built-in methods.
